        <h2>The future of brands.</h2>
        
        <p>Over the past few years, technology that empowers great design and content has advanced rapidly. The way brands are created, implemented — and how they evolve — is undergoing dramatic and fast-paced change.</p>
        
        <p>Brands of the future are inherently dynamic, AI-native, and with an ever-growing range of elements. Yet, many of the tools we rely on to create, evolve, and scale our brands are struggling to keep up. Quite frankly, the traditional brand "toolbox" feels completely outdated. We were promised efficiency, consistency, and compliance — but what we got was just another tool that requires humans to repeat the same upload/download and copy/paste tasks.</p>
        
        <p>Brail is built by people with 30+ years combined experience in DAM, brand consultancies, brand design and brand tech. We believe it's time to rethink the format.</p>
