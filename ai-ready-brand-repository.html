          Out of the box, most brands aren't usable by AI. Studies show that as much as 80% of all generated content are currently off-brand. Even with a DAM and brand guidelines in place, the data isn't structured in a way AI tools can read automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          For brands to use AI tools at scale — across multiple teams, channels, and tools — hours of constant, repetitive training and prompting is currently the best method. Repeated each time a new person or new tool is onboarded. Even then, after all of this manual work, the context window of each tool doesn't allow it to understand the whole brand universe like you do. Sure, it can give you a hex code — but context across thousands of files? Forget it.

          This is where Brail comes in. We transform your existing (or help launch a new) brand system into a structured, AI-readable endpoint that syncs with whatever AI tool you use. With a Brail connection, AI tools can natively "dip into" the brand knowledge exactly when they need it — no specific uploading, prompting or training needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          You set up Brail once, and your "brand brain" can now be connected to any product, tool, model, agent or application you want to use (or build).
