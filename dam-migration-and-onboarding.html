      <h1>DAM migrations & onboarding</h1>
      
      <div class="subpage-intro">
        <p>
Today, most DAM migrations and onboarding projects are built on the backbone of manual labour. Asset fetching, clean-up and verifications, metadata schemas, categorization strategies, asset structuring, importing, recreating visual frontends. The work is vast, only matched by the friction experienced by both DAM vendors and Enterprises.        </p>
        <p>
There’s 2 real choices. Either a brand invest $100K with a consultancy to move, structure and import assets they already have — or the DAM handles the manual implementation internally, sharing or swallowing the cost (depending on the negotiations). Either way it takes 3+ months before value is achieved, and no one is particularly happy.        </p>
      <p>
        This is where Brail comes in. Our system uses state-of-the-art AI models to automatically import, clean, structure, and understand brand assets and guidelines. It then provides you with this brand data through brand endpoints you can use to import and implement whole brand setups in hours instead of weeks.
