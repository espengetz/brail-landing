      <h1>DAM migrations & onboarding</h1>
      
      <div class="subpage-intro">
        <p>
          Today, most DAM migrations are projects requiring asset fetching, clean-up and verifications, metadata schemas, categorization strategies, asset structuring, and often manually recreating brand guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of this work is done manually, making the process take 2-6 months and cost up to $1.5 per asset ($150K for 100,000 assets). Even then, the results isn't particularly good..
        </p>

          This is where Brail comes in. Our system uses state-of-the-art AI models to automatically import, structure, and understand brand data. It then provides you with this data through brand endpoints you can use to migrate to any DAM vendor — whenever you please.
